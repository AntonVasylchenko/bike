The constant quantitative growth and scope of our activism allows us to carry out important tasks in developing directions for progressive development. Ideological considerations of the highest order, as well as the constant growth in numbers and the scope of our activity, play an important role in shaping the positions taken by the participants with respect to the tasks at hand.

                        In this way the further development of the various forms of activity contributes to the preparation and realization of the positions taken by the participants with regard to the tasks at hand.</p>
